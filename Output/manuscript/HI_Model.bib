	abstract = {Gross primary production (GPP) is the Earth’s largest carbon flux into the terrestrial biosphere and plays a critical role in regulating atmospheric chemistry and global climate. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)-MOD17 data product is a widely used remote sensing-based model that provides global estimates of spatiotemporal trends in GPP. When the MOD17 algorithm is applied to regional scale heterogeneous landscapes, input data from coarse resolution land cover and climate products may increase uncertainty in GPP estimates, especially in high productivity tropical ecosystems. We examined the influence of using locally specific land cover and high-resolution local climate input data on MOD17 estimates of GPP for the State of Hawaii, a heterogeneous and discontinuous tropical landscape. Replacing the global land cover data input product (MOD12Q1) with Hawaii-specific land cover data reduced statewide GPP estimates by {\textasciitilde}8\%, primarily because the Hawaii-specific land cover map had less vegetated land area compared to the global land cover product. Replacing coarse resolution GMAO climate data with Hawaii-specific high-resolution climate data also reduced statewide GPP estimates by {\textasciitilde}8\% because of the higher spatial variability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the Hawaii-specific climate data. The combined use of both Hawaii-specific land cover and high-resolution Hawaii climate data inputs reduced statewide GPP by {\textasciitilde}16\%, suggesting equal and independent influence on MOD17 GPP estimates. Our sensitivity analyses within a heterogeneous tropical landscape suggest that refined global land cover and climate data sets may contribute to an enhanced MOD17 product at a variety of spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) can have profound effects on terrestrial carbon dynamics, yet their effects on the global carbon budget remain uncertain. While land change impacts on ecosystem carbon dynamics have been the focus of numerous studies, few efforts have been based on observational data incorporating multiple ecosystem types spanning large geographic areas over long time horizons. In this study we use a variety of synoptic-scale remote sensing data to estimate the effect of LULC changes associated with urbanization, agricultural expansion and contraction, forest harvest, and wildfire on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems (forest, grasslands, shrublands, and agriculture) in the conterminous United States (i.e. excluding Alaska and Hawaii) between 1973 and 2010. We estimate large net declines in the area of agriculture and forest, along with relatively small increases in grasslands and shrublands. The largest net change in any class was an estimated gain of 114 865 km 2 of developed lands, an average rate of 3282 km 2 yr −1 . On average, US ecosystems sequestered carbon at an annual rate of 254 Tg C yr −1 . In forest lands, the net sink declined by 35\% over the study period, largely a result of land-use legacy, increasing disturbances, and reductions in forest area due to land use conversion. Uncertainty in LULC change data contributed to a 16\% margin of error in the annual carbon sink estimate prior to 1985 (approximately ±40 Tg C yr −1 ). Improvements in LULC and disturbance mapping starting in the mid-1980s reduced this uncertainty by 50\% after 1985. We conclude that changes in LULC are a critical component to understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics, and continued improvements in detection, quantification, and attribution of change have the potential to significantly reduce current uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Seasonal mean rainfall projections for Hawai‘i are given based on statistical downscaling of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) global model results for two future representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The spatial information content of our statistical downscaling method is improved over previous efforts through the inclusion of spatially extensive, high-quality monthly rainfall data set and the use of improved large-scale climate predictor information. Predictor variables include moisture transport in the middle atmosphere (700 hPa), vertical temperature gradients, and geopotential height fields of the 1000 and 500 hPa layers. The results allow for the first time to derive a spatially interpolated map with future rainfall change estimates for the main Hawaiian Islands. The statistical downscaling was applied to project wet (November–April) and dry (May–October) season rainfall anomalies for the middle and late 21st century. Overall, the statistical downscaling gives more reliable results for the wet season than for the dry season. The wet-season results indicate a pronounced dipole structure between windward facing mountain slopes and the leeward side of most of the islands. The climatically wet regions on the windward slopes of the mountain regions are expected to become wetter or remain stable in their seasonal precipitation amounts. On the climatically dry leeward sides of Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Maui, and Hawai‘i Island, future precipitation exhibits the strongest drying trends. The projected future rainfall anomaly pattern is associated with a circulation anomaly that resembles a shift in the position or strength of the subtropical high and the average location of extratropical troughs. These new results suggest that a negative trend dominates the area-averaged changes in the statistical downscaling over the Hawaiian Islands. However, the islands are expected to experience a greater contrast between the wet and dry regions in the future.},

	abstract = {Regional climate change scenarios are important for understanding their impacts on environments of oceanic islands. This study presents a statistical method that estimates elevation-dependent warming rates for the Hawaiian Islands. The downscaling is facilitated by two important aspects found in the climate change scenarios produced by general circulation models. First, climate model simulations show a strong relationship between height and amplitude of the temperature change over the northern subtropical Pacific. Second, the ratio between the upper air temperature and the surface temperature change is independent of the global warming rate. This information is exploited to produce high-resolution maps with the expected range of future temperature changes for the Hawaiian Islands by the mid and late 21st century. The expected surface warming and its uncertainty is analysed with an ensemble of global climate scenarios for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5). It is found that the highest mountain elevations warm by a factor 1.5 ± 0.2 compared with the ambient surface temperature anomalies at the sea level. In scenario RCP8.5, high elevations above 3000 m reach up to 4–5 °C warmer temperatures by the late 21st century. The uncertainty due to multi-model ensemble spread is overall larger than the statistical downscaling uncertainty, except for the highest elevations where both contribute equally to the uncertainty range. For the late 21st century, however, the largest uncertainty stems from the choice of emission scenarios.},

Our objective was to summarize the available wildfire data for Hawai‘i and synthesize the social and ecological dimensions of wildfire drivers, impacts, and management responses. We constructed a 110-yr span of wildfire records for the state of Hawai‘i to examine historical trends (1904–2011) and summarized relationships between contemporary wildfire occurrence (2005–2011) and land use/land cover types and human population. Total area burned statewide increased more than fourfold from 1904 to 1959 to peaks in the 1960s–1970s and mid-1990s to present. From 2005 to 2011, on average, 1,007 wildfires were reported across the state per year (±77 SE), burning an average of 8,427 ha yr-1 (±2,394 SE). Most fires (95\%) were {\textless}4 ha, while most area burned (93\%) was attributed to fires ≥40 ha. Ignition frequency was positively correlated with human population across islands. Wildfires were most frequent in developed areas, but most areas burned occurred in dry nonnative grasslands and shrublands that currently compose 24\% of Hawai‘i’s total land cover. These grass-dominated landscapes allow wildfires to propagate rapidly from areas of high ignition frequencies into the forested margins of the state's watersheds, placing native habitat, watershed integrity, and human safety at risk. There is an urgent need to better assess fire risk and impacts at landscape scales and increase the integration of prefire planning and prevention into existing land management goals.},

	abstract = {Land-use changes are the second largest source of human-induced greenhouse gas emission, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. CO2 emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (−25\%) and perennial crops (−30\%) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12\%. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (−9\%) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29\%) or under cropland fallow (+32\%) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26\%). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28\%. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems are an important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), sequestering {\textasciitilde}30\% of annual anthropogenic emissions and slowing the rise of atmospheric CO2. However, the future direction and magnitude of the land sink is highly uncertain. We examined how historical and projected changes in climate, land use, and ecosystem disturbances affect the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in California over the period 2001–2100. We modeled 32 unique scenarios, spanning 4 land use and 2 radiative forcing scenarios as simulated by four global climate models. Between 2001 and 2015, carbon storage in California's terrestrial ecosystems declined by −188.4 Tg C, with a mean annual flux ranging from a source of −89.8 Tg C/ year to a sink of 60.1 Tg C/year. The large variability in the magnitude of the state's carbon source/sink was primarily attributable to interannual variability in weather and climate, which affected the rate of carbon uptake in vegetation and the rate of ecosystem respiration. Under nearly all future scenarios, carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems was projected to decline, with an average loss of −9.4\% (−432.3 Tg C) by the year 2100 from current stocks. However, uncertainty in the magnitude of carbon loss was high, with individual scenario projections ranging from −916.2 to 121.2 Tg C and was largely driven by differences in future climate conditions projected by climate models. Moving from a high to a low radiative forcing scenario reduced net ecosystem carbon loss by 21\% and when combined with reductions in land‐use change (i.e., moving from a high to a low land‐use scenario), net carbon losses were reduced by 55\% on average. However, reconciling large uncertainties associated with the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 is needed to better constrain models used to establish baseline conditions from which ecosystem‐based climate mitigation strategies can be evaluated.},

Although leaf-level net photosynthesis is typically stimulated by exposure to elevated {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} (e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), it is unclear how this stimulation translates into carbon cycle responses at the ecosystem scale. Here we estimate a key component of the carbon cycle, the gross primary productivity (GPP), of a mature native eucalypt forest exposed to free-air {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} enrichment (the EucFACE experiment). In this experiment, light-saturated leaf photosynthesis increased by 19\&thinsp;\% in response to a 38\&thinsp;\% increase in {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. We used the process-based forest canopy model, MAESPA, to upscale these leaf-level measurements of photosynthesis with canopy structure to estimate the GPP and its response to e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. We assessed the direct impact of e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, as well as the indirect effect of photosynthetic acclimation to e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and variability among treatment plots using different model scenarios.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}At the canopy scale, MAESPA estimated a GPP of 1574\&thinsp;g\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} under ambient conditions across 4 years and a direct increase in the GPP of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater}11\&thinsp;\% in response to e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. The smaller canopy-scale response simulated by the model, as compared with the leaf-level response, could be attributed to the prevalence of RuBP regeneration limitation of leaf photosynthesis within the canopy. Photosynthetic acclimation reduced this estimated response to 10\&thinsp;\%. After taking the baseline variability in the leaf area index across plots in account, we estimated a field GPP response to e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} of 6\&thinsp;\% with a 95\&thinsp;\% confidence interval ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}2\&thinsp;\%, 14\&thinsp;\%). These findings highlight that the GPP response of mature forests to e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} is likely to be considerably lower than the response of light-saturated leaf photosynthesis. Our results provide an important context for interpreting the e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} responses of other components of the ecosystem carbon cycle.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Central to the success of trees are their woody bodies, which connect their elevated photosynthetic canopies with the essential belowground activities of water and nutrient acquisition. The slow construction of these carbon-dense, woody skeletons leads to a slow generation time, leaving trees and forests highly susceptible to rapid changes in climate. Other long-lived, sessile organisms such as corals appear to be poorly equipped to survive rapid changes, which raises questions about the vulnerability of contemporary forests to future climate change. The emerging view that, similar to corals, tree species have rather inflexible damage thresholds, particularly in terms of water stress, is especially concerning. This Review examines recent progress in our understanding of how the future looks for forests growing in a hotter and drier atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Here we present a new terrestrial biosphere model (the Integrated Biosphere Simulator - IBIS) which demonstrates how land surface biophysics, terrestrial carbon fluxes, and global vegetation dynamics can be represented in a single, physically consistent modeling framework. In order to integrate a wide range of biophysical, physiological, and ecological processes, the model is designed around a hierarchical, modular structure and uses a common state description throughout. First, a coupled simulation of the surface water, energy, and carbon fluxes is performed on hourly timesteps and is integrated over the year to estimate the annual water and carbon balance. Next, the annual carbon balance is used to predict changes in the leaf area index and biomass for each of nine plant functional types, which compete for light and water using different ecological strategies. The resulting patterns of annual evapotranspiration, runoff, and net primary productivity are in good agreement with observations. In addition, the model simulates patterns of vegetation dynamics that qualitatively agree with features of the natural process of secondary succession. Comparison of the model's inferred near-equilibrium vegetation categories with a potential natural vegetation map shows a fair degree of agreement. This integrated modeling framework provides a means of simulating both rapid biophysical processes and long-term ecosystem dynamics that can be directly incorporated within atmospheric models.},

	abstract = {Mitigation of climate change by intentionally storing carbon in tropical forests, soils, and wetlands and by reducing greenhouse gas ﬂuxes from these settings has been promoted as rapidly deployable and cost‐effective. This approach, sometimes referred to as “natural climate solutions,” could keep post‐industrialization warming below 1.5 °C, when coupled with reductions in fossil fuel emissions, as conﬁrmed here with a simple numerical model of future emissions. However, such mitigation could cease in response to changes in future climate, land use, or natural resource policies, or there could be CO2 released from reservoirs of stored carbon. Model simulations suggest cumulative emissions could be similar, under scenarios where carbon storage ceases, or stored carbon is released, to emissions expected in the absence of any natural mitigation. If climate change is to be minimized, no‐regrets approaches to natural mitigation should be considered (e.g., by reducing deforestation), as emissions targets that could limit warming to 1.5 °C cannot be met without mitigation of this magnitude. However, additional mitigation options should also be evaluated that can reduce CO2 emissions and remove CO2 from the air (and store it permanently). Plain Language Summary One option for ﬁghting climate change involves “natural climate solutions” that would remove atmospheric CO2 by storing carbon in tropical forests, soils, and wetlands and would minimize greenhouse gas ﬂuxes from such environments. With a simple computer code to predict future emissions, I conﬁrm that such natural mitigation could, along with reductions in fossil fuel emissions, help keep the average global post‐industrialization temperature rise below 1.5 °C and could help delay impacts of climate change. However, future changes in climate, land use, or natural resource policies could cause natural mitigation to cease and emissions to increase, and modeling suggests levels could approach those expected in the absence of natural mitigation, which would negate much of the intended beneﬁt. We should prioritize “no‐regrets” natural mitigation, including stopping deforestation, that can provide time to develop other needed mitigation options to remove atmospheric CO2 and permanently store it.},

Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} emissions ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{FF}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land use change ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{LUC}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} concentration is measured directly and its growth rate ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{G}$_{\textrm{ATM}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sink ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{S}$_{\textrm{OCEAN}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) and terrestrial {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sink ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{S}$_{\textrm{LAND}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{B}$_{\textrm{IM}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle.

A detailed comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad range of observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent underestimation of the {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} variability by ocean models outside the tropics.
