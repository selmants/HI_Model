	abstract = {Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) can have profound effects on terrestrial carbon dynamics, yet their effects on the global carbon budget remain uncertain. While land change impacts on ecosystem carbon dynamics have been the focus of numerous studies, few efforts have been based on observational data incorporating multiple ecosystem types spanning large geographic areas over long time horizons. In this study we use a variety of synoptic-scale remote sensing data to estimate the effect of LULC changes associated with urbanization, agricultural expansion and contraction, forest harvest, and wildfire on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems (forest, grasslands, shrublands, and agriculture) in the conterminous United States (i.e. excluding Alaska and Hawaii) between 1973 and 2010. We estimate large net declines in the area of agriculture and forest, along with relatively small increases in grasslands and shrublands. The largest net change in any class was an estimated gain of 114 865 km 2 of developed lands, an average rate of 3282 km 2 yr −1 . On average, US ecosystems sequestered carbon at an annual rate of 254 Tg C yr −1 . In forest lands, the net sink declined by 35\% over the study period, largely a result of land-use legacy, increasing disturbances, and reductions in forest area due to land use conversion. Uncertainty in LULC change data contributed to a 16\% margin of error in the annual carbon sink estimate prior to 1985 (approximately ±40 Tg C yr −1 ). Improvements in LULC and disturbance mapping starting in the mid-1980s reduced this uncertainty by 50\% after 1985. We conclude that changes in LULC are a critical component to understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics, and continued improvements in detection, quantification, and attribution of change have the potential to significantly reduce current uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Seasonal mean rainfall projections for Hawai‘i are given based on statistical downscaling of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) global model results for two future representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The spatial information content of our statistical downscaling method is improved over previous efforts through the inclusion of spatially extensive, high-quality monthly rainfall data set and the use of improved large-scale climate predictor information. Predictor variables include moisture transport in the middle atmosphere (700 hPa), vertical temperature gradients, and geopotential height fields of the 1000 and 500 hPa layers. The results allow for the first time to derive a spatially interpolated map with future rainfall change estimates for the main Hawaiian Islands. The statistical downscaling was applied to project wet (November–April) and dry (May–October) season rainfall anomalies for the middle and late 21st century. Overall, the statistical downscaling gives more reliable results for the wet season than for the dry season. The wet-season results indicate a pronounced dipole structure between windward facing mountain slopes and the leeward side of most of the islands. The climatically wet regions on the windward slopes of the mountain regions are expected to become wetter or remain stable in their seasonal precipitation amounts. On the climatically dry leeward sides of Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Maui, and Hawai‘i Island, future precipitation exhibits the strongest drying trends. The projected future rainfall anomaly pattern is associated with a circulation anomaly that resembles a shift in the position or strength of the subtropical high and the average location of extratropical troughs. These new results suggest that a negative trend dominates the area-averaged changes in the statistical downscaling over the Hawaiian Islands. However, the islands are expected to experience a greater contrast between the wet and dry regions in the future.},

	abstract = {Regional climate change scenarios are important for understanding their impacts on environments of oceanic islands. This study presents a statistical method that estimates elevation-dependent warming rates for the Hawaiian Islands. The downscaling is facilitated by two important aspects found in the climate change scenarios produced by general circulation models. First, climate model simulations show a strong relationship between height and amplitude of the temperature change over the northern subtropical Pacific. Second, the ratio between the upper air temperature and the surface temperature change is independent of the global warming rate. This information is exploited to produce high-resolution maps with the expected range of future temperature changes for the Hawaiian Islands by the mid and late 21st century. The expected surface warming and its uncertainty is analysed with an ensemble of global climate scenarios for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5). It is found that the highest mountain elevations warm by a factor 1.5 ± 0.2 compared with the ambient surface temperature anomalies at the sea level. In scenario RCP8.5, high elevations above 3000 m reach up to 4–5 °C warmer temperatures by the late 21st century. The uncertainty due to multi-model ensemble spread is overall larger than the statistical downscaling uncertainty, except for the highest elevations where both contribute equally to the uncertainty range. For the late 21st century, however, the largest uncertainty stems from the choice of emission scenarios.},

	abstract = {Land-use changes are the second largest source of human-induced greenhouse gas emission, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. CO2 emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (−25\%) and perennial crops (−30\%) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12\%. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (−9\%) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29\%) or under cropland fallow (+32\%) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26\%). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28\%. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems are an important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), sequestering {\textasciitilde}30\% of annual anthropogenic emissions and slowing the rise of atmospheric CO2. However, the future direction and magnitude of the land sink is highly uncertain. We examined how historical and projected changes in climate, land use, and ecosystem disturbances affect the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in California over the period 2001–2100. We modeled 32 unique scenarios, spanning 4 land use and 2 radiative forcing scenarios as simulated by four global climate models. Between 2001 and 2015, carbon storage in California's terrestrial ecosystems declined by −188.4 Tg C, with a mean annual flux ranging from a source of −89.8 Tg C/ year to a sink of 60.1 Tg C/year. The large variability in the magnitude of the state's carbon source/sink was primarily attributable to interannual variability in weather and climate, which affected the rate of carbon uptake in vegetation and the rate of ecosystem respiration. Under nearly all future scenarios, carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems was projected to decline, with an average loss of −9.4\% (−432.3 Tg C) by the year 2100 from current stocks. However, uncertainty in the magnitude of carbon loss was high, with individual scenario projections ranging from −916.2 to 121.2 Tg C and was largely driven by differences in future climate conditions projected by climate models. Moving from a high to a low radiative forcing scenario reduced net ecosystem carbon loss by 21\% and when combined with reductions in land‐use change (i.e., moving from a high to a low land‐use scenario), net carbon losses were reduced by 55\% on average. However, reconciling large uncertainties associated with the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 is needed to better constrain models used to establish baseline conditions from which ecosystem‐based climate mitigation strategies can be evaluated.},

Although leaf-level net photosynthesis is typically stimulated by exposure to elevated {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} (e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), it is unclear how this stimulation translates into carbon cycle responses at the ecosystem scale. Here we estimate a key component of the carbon cycle, the gross primary productivity (GPP), of a mature native eucalypt forest exposed to free-air {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} enrichment (the EucFACE experiment).

We used the process-based forest canopy model, MAESPA, to upscale these leaf-level measurements of photosynthesis with canopy structure to estimate the GPP and its response to e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}.

The smaller canopy-scale response simulated by the model, as compared with the leaf-level response, could be attributed to the prevalence of RuBP regeneration limitation of leaf photosynthesis within the canopy. Photosynthetic acclimation reduced this estimated response to 10\&thinsp;\%. After taking the baseline variability in the leaf area index across plots in account, we estimated a field GPP response to e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} of 6\&thinsp;\% with a 95\&thinsp;\% confidence interval ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}2\&thinsp;\%, 14\&thinsp;\%). These findings highlight that the GPP response of mature forests to e{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{C}$_{\textrm{a}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} is likely to be considerably lower than the response of light-saturated leaf photosynthesis.

	abstract = {Trees are the living foundations on which most terrestrial biodiversity is built. Central to the success of trees are their woody bodies, which connect their elevated photosynthetic canopies with the essential belowground activities of water and nutrient acquisition. The slow construction of these carbon-dense, woody skeletons leads to a slow generation time, leaving trees and forests highly susceptible to rapid changes in climate. Other long-lived, sessile organisms such as corals appear to be poorly equipped to survive rapid changes, which raises questions about the vulnerability of contemporary forests to future climate change. The emerging view that, similar to corals, tree species have rather inflexible damage thresholds, particularly in terms of water stress, is especially concerning. This Review examines recent progress in our understanding of how the future looks for forests growing in a hotter and drier atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Here we present a new terrestrial biosphere model (the Integrated Biosphere Simulator - IBIS) which demonstrates how land surface biophysics, terrestrial carbon fluxes, and global vegetation dynamics can be represented in a single, physically consistent modeling framework. In order to integrate a wide range of biophysical, physiological, and ecological processes, the model is designed around a hierarchical, modular structure and uses a common state description throughout. First, a coupled simulation of the surface water, energy, and carbon fluxes is performed on hourly timesteps and is integrated over the year to estimate the annual water and carbon balance. Next, the annual carbon balance is used to predict changes in the leaf area index and biomass for each of nine plant functional types, which compete for light and water using different ecological strategies. The resulting patterns of annual evapotranspiration, runoff, and net primary productivity are in good agreement with observations. In addition, the model simulates patterns of vegetation dynamics that qualitatively agree with features of the natural process of secondary succession. Comparison of the model's inferred near-equilibrium vegetation categories with a potential natural vegetation map shows a fair degree of agreement. This integrated modeling framework provides a means of simulating both rapid biophysical processes and long-term ecosystem dynamics that can be directly incorporated within atmospheric models.},
