## Abstract
The State of Hawai`i passed legislation in 2018 setting a goal to be carbon neutral by 2045. Meeting this goal will partly depend on carbon sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems, yet the future direction and magnitude of the land carbon sink in the Hawaiian Islands is highly uncertain. We used simulation modeling to assess how projected future changes in climate and land use will influence ecosystem carbon balance in the Hawaiian Islands under four unique scenarios over a 90-year timespan. Net ecosystem carbon balance declined under all four scenarios. Moving from a high to a low radiative forcing scenario reduced net ecosystem carbon loss by ~21%, and net carbon losses were reduced by a total of ~55% under the combined scenario of low radiative forcing and low rates of land‐use change. A sensitivity test of the CO~2~ fertilization effect on plant productivity revealed it to be a major source of uncertainty in projections of ecosystem carbon balance. Reconciling this uncertainty in how net photosynthesis will respond to rising atmospheric CO~2~ will be essential to better constrainment of models used to evaluate the effectiveness of ecosystem‐based climate mitigation strategies.   

## Introduction

## Methods
We used the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS), an integrated landscape change and carbon gain-loss model, to project changes in ecosystem carbon balance for the seven main Hawaiian Islands under four scenarios of climate and land-use change. The landscape change portion of LUCAS is a state-and-transition model that applies a Monte Carlo approach to track the state type and age of each simulation cell in response to a pre-determined set of transitions [@daniel_state-and-transition_2016]. The carbon gain-loss portion tracks carbon stocks within each simulation cell over time as continuous state variables, along with a pre-defined set of continuous flows specifying stock level rates of change over time [@daniel_integrating_2018; @sleeter_effects_2019]. We parameterized the Hawai`i LUCAS model to estimate annual changes in carbon stocks and fluxes in response to land use, land use change, wildland fire, and long-term climate variability. Simulations were run for 90 years at an annual timestep, using initial conditions corresponding to the year 2010. All simulations were repeated for 30 Monte Carlo realizations.

### *Study area*
The spatial extent of this study was the terrestrial portion of the seven main Hawaiian Islands (Figure 1), a total land area of 16,554 km^2^. We subdivided this landscape into a grid of 264,870 simulation cells, each of which was 250 x 250 m in size. Each simulation cell was assigned to one of 210 possible state types based on the unique combination of three moisture zones (dry, mesic, and wet; Figure S1), seven islands, and ten discrete land cover classes (Figure 1).

Water and Wetland land cover classes are not shown."}

### *States and transitions*
Transition pathways were modified from @daniel_state-and-transition_2016 and @selmants_baseline_2017. Transitions between state types were pre-defined to represent urbanization, agricultural contraction, agricultural expansion, harvesting of tree plantations, and wildfire. Agriculture, forest, grassland, tree plantation, and shrubland state types each had multiple transition pathways, while the barren state type could only transition to urban. Although several state types could transition to urban, there was no transition pathway from urban to any other state type. Water and wetland state types remained static throughout the simulation period. We developed a high and a low land-use scenario, with transition targets based on historical trends of land use change and population projections [@kim_population_2018].

For the high land-use scenario, annual transition targets for agricultural contraction, agricultural expansion, and urbanization were based on
